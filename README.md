# Introduction to React TypeScript

React TypeScript is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created and maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create components, manage state and data, and create an efficient and interactive user interface. With TypeScript, developers can write code in a type-safe language and have access to advanced features like type-checking, object-oriented features, and type inference.

# Installing Dependencies

To get started with React TypeScript, you will need to install all the required dependencies. To do this, use the `npm install` command in your terminal.

# Create .env File

Once the dependencies have been installed, create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. This file contains environment variables that are used in your React TypeScript application. Make sure to edit the values in the file according to your own configuration.

# Run with npm

Once everything is set up, you can run your React TypeScript application with the `npm run start` command. This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.
